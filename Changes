Revision history for Perl extension IPC::ChildSafe.

0.01  Sat Nov 29 12:03:06 1997
	- Original version; created by h2xs 1.18

1.01  Mon Dec 01 22:23:14 1997
	- First release. There are a few bells and whistles I would
	like to add yet, but this version seems stable.  Might as well
	get feedback before implementing the b&w.

2.00  Mon Mar 09 22:23:14 1998
	- Reworked the entire perl interface using one 'smart' method
	$obj->command.  This detects whether it was run in a scalar or list
	context and either dumps all output to true stdout/stderr and
	returns the exit status (scalar case) or returns it all plus the
	exit status in a hash (list case).

	Added a function for registering an error-checking routine.
	This allows the user to set up their preferred regular expression
	(or other algorithm) for determining which output constitutes
	an error condition.

2.02  Sat Apr 11 15:23:14 1998
	- Added a third mode to the $obj->command method;
	if called in a void context it now will exit on failure.

	- As a result of the above improvement, moved the required
	perl version up to 5.004 since the wantarray() feature
	which enables it was added only in 5.004.

2.10  Sun Apr 26 15:23:14 1998
	- Renamed to IPC::ChildSafe as a result of discussions
	on modules@perl.org.

	- Reworked to use a hash to represent the object.  This allowed
	a rethinking of how $obj->command behaves in scalar context. Now,
	when used in scalar it will store all generated output in arrays
	_STDOUT and _STDERR.  This data can be retrieved later using the
	new methods 'stdout' and 'stderr'.

	- Added a related feature; when $obj->command() is called in a
	void context and with no arguments, it flushes (throws away) the
	stored results.

2.20  Sun May 10 17:43:44 1998
	- Added the ability to handle stderr differently via
	$obj->command("cmd" => IGNORE) etc.

	- Added $obj->status method to poll the currently-stored
	stderr for an error count.

	- Moved ClearCase-specific comments out to subclassed
	  IPC::ClearTool module.

2.25  Sun May 17 12:34:46 1998
	- Renamed $obj->command() to $obj->cmd() for brevity.
	  Left old method in place but de-documented.

2.26  Mon Sep 28 09:44:12 EDT 1998
	- Fixed a bug causing multiple instances to overwrite each other.

2.27  Mon Oct 19 16:25:14 EDT 1998
	- Fixed a couple of doc bugs

2.28  Sat Jan  9 19:52:07 EST 1999
	- Updated XS code to compile under perl5.006 and above
	  (cleaned up -DPERL_POLLUTE macros).

2.29  Mon Jan 11 10:12:25 EST 1999
	- Previous fix (2.28) turned out to break with perl <5.006.

2.30 Fri Oct  1 08:07:12 EDT 1999
	- Fixed a timing bug which caused it to report failure status
	  for the child process on Linux. I was assuming the child must
	  have ended before the call to waitpid(), but that was a sloppy
	  assumption which for whatever reason was always true on
	  Solaris but never true on Linux. Now I do the right thing.
	- Made some minor documentation improvements.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is really a trivial subclass of IPC::ChildSafe.  While I
originally wrote ChildSafe to work with cleartool, I wanted to design
it in an open manner which didn't preclude use with other utilities.
But this had the effect of making it slightly harder and more
mysterious to use it with cleartool, since the user had to pass the
magic 'tag' and 'eot' strings and perhaps modify the error
discriminator. So I ended up making this module, which simply provides
a new contructor method with the correct defaults for cleartool,
and inherits everything else from ChildSafe.

This module is of no value unless you have ClearCase installed, and in
fact the tests will fail if you don't. And even if you have ClearCase
you may still prefer to use IPC::ChildSafe directly.

See the documentation for IPC::ChildSafe for further details.

LATEST VERSION
--------------

This module is only available bundled with IPC::ChildSafe.  If there is
a newer version of that, it will most likely be found on CPAN.  Or you
can reach the author at dsb@world.std.com.

INSTALLING
----------

Installation consists of the usual sequence of commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

TESTED PLATFORMS
----------------

This will work an any platform where IPC::ChildSafe works.

Revision history for Perl extension IPC::ClearTool.

1.00  Mon May  4 15:09:16 1998
	- A trivial subclass of IPC::ChildSafe->new() which simply
	  defaults its args to some which make it work with cleartool.

2.00 Wed Dec  1 23:00:07 EST 1999
	- Ported to Windows NT/ClearCase 4.0. This is done by using
	  the ClearCase Automation Library (aka CAL) COM interface
	  instead of the XS layer used on UNIX.
